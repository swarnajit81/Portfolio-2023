            I&apos;ve always been an artist, an admirer of mysticism and abstract arts. And creating immersive web experiences that leaves user itself in awe, is an art which has been justified. I thrive for that awe considering me being the artist and creator of such web canvas. As Nietzsche said , <q>art is the highest form of self-expression and a way to affirm life</q>

            After working 3 years at Boardriders headquarters, I now decide to
            go freelance to work on new and exciting ideas surrounded by
            talented people.
            <br />
            <br /> For each project I work on, I pay particular attention to the
            interaction, animations and performance of your site, so that your
            users enjoy a pleasant experience throughout their visit.
            <br />
            <br />
            All this is just the beginning, and I canâ€™t wait to push it even
            further by working with you on your next project.
