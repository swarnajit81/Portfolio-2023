            I've always wanted to create new things, unique experiences, getting
            into web development changed a lot of things for me, and since then,
            I try to push my work to new horizons with each project, always
            putting quality first.

            After working 3 years at Boardriders headquarters, I now decide to
            go freelance to work on new and exciting ideas surrounded by
            talented people.
            <br />
            <br /> For each project I work on, I pay particular attention to the
            interaction, animations and performance of your site, so that your
            users enjoy a pleasant experience throughout their visit.
            <br />
            <br />
            All this is just the beginning, and I canâ€™t wait to push it even
            further by working with you on your next project.
